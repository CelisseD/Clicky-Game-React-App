# Overview 

This memory game was built as part of UCF's Coding Bootcamp and is authored by Celisse Dones.

Golden Girls Memory Game features your favorite feisty ladies from the 80s. I used React to create a game board of gifs, which are randomly shuffled every time the user clicks on one. Try to click on a different gif every time to earn points. Click on the same gif twice and you lose the game. üëµüèº
